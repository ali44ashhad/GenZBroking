              That matters. It means there are rules we have to follow, and we're more than okay with that.

          <div className="space-y-6 leading-relaxed text-[15px]">
            <p>
              SGFX was started by a group of professionals who've worked in the financial industry long 
              enough to know where it works, and where it doesn't. We've seen platforms overpromise 
              and underdeliver. We've seen traders pushed into setups that don't really serve them.
            </p>
            <p>
              So we built SGFX to do the opposite. We're here to keep things focused, grounded, and 
              aligned with what real traders actually need: fair conditions, useful tools, fast execution, 
              and someone who answers when you call. It's our commitment to our clients that makes us 
              a partner, not just a platform provider.
